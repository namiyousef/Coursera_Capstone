**Abstract**

**Introduction**

1.  **Background**

Imperial College London is a STEM university situated in South
Kensington: a cultural area full of museums, parks, restaurants, shops
and hotels. As such, the university's campus is fairly small, and has
minimal accommodation to offer students after their first year at
university. This results in the vast majority finding private
accommodation, typically a couple of miles away from South Kensington,
due to the high flat prices (per meter squared) in the
area.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

With this, commute to university becomes much longer, with many opting
to cycle, use the bus or the tube (underground train) instead, while
student safety decreases due to increased crime rates further away from
university. Of course, other areas have their own positives, as they
typically have younger demographics, are more diverse, can be more
'trendy' and offer access to other amenities, such as
nightclubs.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

At the moment, students are able to find correct properties (in terms of
price and location) through trial and error (on website such as
[[rightmove.co.uk]{.s1}](http://rightmove.co.uk) and
[[zoopla.co.uk]{.s1}](http://zoopla.co.uk)) or by consulting with
real-estate agencies, such as Foxtons or Dexters. However, there exists
no mechanism by which students can *understand* the type of
neighbourhood or area wherein they look for housing. Ideally, students
would be able to answer a couple of questions regarding what they
consider to be important features in a neighbourhood, and get answers in
the form of 'suitable' neighbourhoods for
them.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

This report aims to explore this problem in more detail and finding a
solution.
